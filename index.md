## About Me

I am a second-year Master student of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am a member of [SLED lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/). I do research on Embodied AI, 3D Computer Vision, and Robotics. I am interested in building and applying foundation models as well as generative models. My research goal is to **facilitate language agents that can perceive in 3D, interact with humans, and ultimately follow complicated instructions in the physical environment**. Toward this goal, my current research focused on language grounding and robot motion planning in the 3D world.

Before joining UMich, I obtained my bachelor's degree in [Applied and Computational Mathematics Science](https://acms.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) where I worked with [Prof. Yunhe feng](https://yunhefeng.me/) on Responsible AI.

I'm currently on the lookout for a Ph.D. position starting Fall 2024. If you're aware of any opportunities, I'd be grateful for an introduction.
