## About Me

I am a second-year Master student of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I am a member of [SLED lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/). I do research on Embodied AI, 3D Computer Vision, and Robotics. I am interested in building and applying foundation models as well as generative models. My ultimate aspiration is to create digital twins that mirror physics, the environment, intelligence, and their integration into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and beyond.

Before joining UMich, I obtained my bachelor's degree in [Applied and Computational Mathematics Science](https://acms.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) where I worked with [Prof. Yunhe feng](https://yunhefeng.me/) on Responsible AI.

I'm currently on the lookout for a Ph.D. position starting Fall 2024. If you're aware of any opportunities, I'd be grateful for an introduction.
